Frontend:
- provide option to submit solution
- view submitted solutions
- patch bubblewrap for SIGWINCH (if using bubblewrap's new-session)
- option to delete own code
- explain how to explore on one's own, beyond the provided exercises
- show confetti animation in full screen mode
- fix font
- fix fullscreen mode in Firefox
- warn on accidental close
- check solutions with --safe again
- show keywords of solutions as hints

Backend:
- accept solution submissions
- relay work in progress to the browser, for safekeeping
- have basic type test
- decouple solution verification from editing
- support reactions to exercises
