# Minimal

Frontend:
- add toc
- inline Agda.css
- clicking opens emacs with preconfigured fold:
  (defun narrow-to-line-range (start-line end-line)
    "Narrow buffer to lines START-LINE to END-LINE."
    (save-excursion
      (goto-line start-line)
      (beginning-of-line)
      (let ((start (point)))
        (goto-line end-line)
        (end-of-line)
        (narrow-to-region start (point)))))

Backend:
- patch bubblewrap for SIGWINCH
- provide container with emacs, files, fold
- detect success


# Advanced

Frontend:
- provide option to submit solution
- view submitted solutions (and reference solution)
- store successes in local storage
- track streak

Backend:
- accept solution submissions
