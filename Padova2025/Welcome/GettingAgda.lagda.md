# Getting Agda

For this tutorial, you do not need to install Agda on your computer. Instead,
an online version of Agda is embedded into this website.

For larger experiments, not tied to the exercises of this tutorial,
you can use the [Agdapad](https://agdapad.quasicoherent.io/). Again, no
installation is required.

For installing Agda on your own computer, check out
[the official Agda website](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php).
